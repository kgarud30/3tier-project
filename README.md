# Horizon Cloud Framework

Horizon Cloud Framework is a three-tier web application architecture developed on AWS, designed for high availability, scalability, and security.

## Architecture Overview

The framework utilizes various AWS services to achieve its goals:

### Frontend
- **Amazon Route 53**: DNS management.
- **CloudFront**: Content delivery network.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic to application servers.

### Application Layer
- **Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: Runs applications in Docker containers.
- **NAT Gateway**: Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet securely.

### Database Layer
- **Relational Database Service (RDS)**: Manages databases with automated backups and scaling.

### Networking
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Provides isolated network infrastructure.
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets for enhanced security.

## Features
- **High Availability**: Implemented automated failover mechanisms using ALB and ECS across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Scalability**: ECS scales containers based on traffic demands.
- **Security**: Utilized NAT Gateway for secure internet access and isolated components within VPC.
